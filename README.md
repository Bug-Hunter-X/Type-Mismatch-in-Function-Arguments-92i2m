# Type Mismatch in Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatch in function arguments.  The `add` function expects two numbers, but a string is passed as an argument, resulting in a type error.

The solution involves type checking and type casting to ensure the function receives and handles the correct data type.

This example highlights the importance of strict type checking in TypeScript to prevent runtime errors.
